# MySQLUpgradeLab
## This is the Lab exercise about upgrading MySQL from 5.7 to 8.4
##
## Note : MySQL 8.4, where the default setting for consistency has changed and mysqlsh default mode is SQL (adding --js is required for JS processing)
##
## Environment :  The provided VM instance has already installed with MySQL enterprise edition binary.
### The /usr/local folder contains the binaries from corresponding tar packages.  
### The soft links are built to standardize the paths to the corresponding tar folders.
	MySQL Home   : /usr/local/mysql
	MySQL Shell  : /usr/local/shell
	MySQL Router : /usr/local/router

## Data
	3310 : /home/mysql/data/3310
	3320 : /home/mysql/data/3320
	3330 : /home/mysql/data/3330

## Preparation
### Ensure there is no mysqld service running.  By default with the provided VM instance, there are 4 active mysql services running.
### Please login as opc and stop those services
1. login as opc
2. Stop the services
```
sudo systemctl stop mysqld@mysql01
sudo systemctl stop mysqld@mysql02
sudo systemctl stop mysqld@mysql03
sudo systemctl stop mysqld
```

3. Check if any mysqld is running
```
ps -ef|grep mysqld
```

4. Switch user to mysql
```
sudo su - mysql
```

5. Using git to clone InnoDB Cluster environment (mysql as user)
```
cd  /home/mysql
mkdir lab
cd lab
git clone https://github.com/ivanxma/InnoDBClusterLab
cd ~/lab/InnoDBClusterLab
```


## The exercise includes



1. Initialization of 3 servers (3310,3320, 3330) on the same VM
2. Configuration for GTID
3. Using MySQL Shell and  Configuring Group Replication Admin User & settings 
4. Creating InnoDB Cluster - 1 member, and add 2nd node using Incremental, and add 3rd node usign Clone
5. Administrating InnoDB Cluster
6. Bootstraping MySQL Router with InnoDB Cluster
7. Creating another 3 servers (3340, 3350, 3360) and building clusterset to link mycluster and mycluster2(3340,3350,3360)
